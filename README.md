## Project- Overview
This project focuses on effective money management, offering financial guidance, and streamlining investment in businesses. Users have the ability to register accounts, record daily income and expenses, and access transaction histories. Additionally, users can contribute to the community by writing money management blogs, which can be liked and commented on by others.
Furthermore, users can showcase their entrepreneurial ventures by adding detailed information about their businesses. All users have the opportunity to invest in these businesses, creating a dynamic investment ecosystem.
The project incorporates two distinct roles – admin and guest. Admins hold the authority to manage user accounts, verify blogs, and validate business posts. This dual-role system ensures a secure and controlled environment for financial activities and community engagement.
